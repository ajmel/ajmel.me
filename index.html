	<p>In my free time I enjoy to code, play videogames and spend quality time with my friends.
	<br />When I'm not doing any of the above I spend time simply thinking about the world.
	<p>These are the programming languages that I know (in order of mastery):</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="languages">Java</li>
		<li class="languages">Python</li>

	<h3>Project Incliner</h3>
	<p> Last year over the summer I attended the MIT Engineering Design Workshop, where I 
	worked alongside other highschool students in order to build an electric longboard.</p>
	
	<p>The idea behind this project was to build and electric longboard driven by your inclination while
	standing on the board; meaning that if you leaned forward the board would move forward and if you leaned
	backward, the board would begin to slow down.</p>
	
	<p>The process took a whole month, from the July 1st 2014 to August 1st of the same year.</p>
	
	<h4>The Method</h4>
	<p>We began by taking an already existing, but no longer working longboard which had motors inside of
	the wheels. The board looked like this:
	<br />

	<br />
	We then hooked up the motors to a motor controller in order to verify that they still worked.
	The motors were then connected to and Arduino, which served as the logic behind the motors, deciding
	what would happend based on the inputs. The motors, Arduino, pressure sensors and other safety and
	utility components were wired using the following schematic: <img src="">
