				<p>My responsibilities were, but not limited to: 
				<br>	•	Assisting with the construction of power electronic equipment
				<br>	•	Designing fixtures for battery testing
				<br>	•	Running tests on motor dynamometers to validate performance of powertrain
				<br>	•	Attend weekly progress meetings
				</p>
				<p>
				I worked as a Powertrain Intern and mainly assistedthe Battery Team. 
				I spent my first few days at the company learning what work was being done 
				in every team and getting to know the people I was going to be working with. 
				I quickly started working on Battery Testing, both on cell and sub-unit level for the Battery Team. 
				Together with another intern we learned how to set up thermal tests for said units, connecting thermocouples, 
				setting the testing rig up and performing the tests.</p>
				<p>As my time at the company progressed, I was getting more and more battery testing requests from various teams 
				in the company and so my role was to manage all the logistics for these tests. This included, writing out a test plan, 
				validating it, designing any necessary rig for testing, building said rig and then performing the test itself. 
				I was also in charge of speaking to external parties to coordinate the use of their machinery for mechanical testing for batteries.</p>
				<p>Apart from mainly helping the battery team with thermal and mechanical testing, I was also involved in the construction of 
				power electronic equipment. I also served as a technician for the Transmission team, helping them assemble some of the very 
				first transmission systems integrated with the motor. In addition, I also helped with some thermal simulations by helping build 
				rigs for thermal tests.</p>
