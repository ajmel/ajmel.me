					<h4>IAP Updates!</h4>
					<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/blog_feb_2017.jpg" width="600px" height="500px" alt="" align="middle"></p>
					<p>It's been a while since I last wrote a blog post. This one is dedicated to show the work I did over the month of January.</p>
					<p>At MIT, the month of January is known as Independent Actitives Periodo (IAP). During this time, students are free to tp what they want.
					Some students stay back home, go on vacation or take classes (for and not for credit) here at MIT.</p>
					<p>Over IAP I took two classes and helped out with manufacturing for FSAE. The first class I took was "How to design EVs", a class where
					we were introduced to the basics of EVs, from batteries and battery pack design to estimating performance for a given vehicle. The second
					class I took was RACECAR, a class were we programmed an autonomous remote control car to autonomously travel around the MIT tunnels using the Robotics
					Operating System (ROS)</p>
					<p>[Video yet to come]</p>
					<p>For the mayor part of IAP I worked with FSAE with manufacturing, primarily for the battery pack for the MY 2017 car. The following are some pictures
					that show the work that was done over IAP. In summary, we machined all of the cell holders for the modules, along with the BMS top cover, glued all cells
					and spot-welded them together. We now have 8 eletrically complete modules along with the enclosure that is going to hold them together in the car. </p>

					<p><img src="assets/img/portfolio/fsae_enclosure.jpg" width="" height=""></p>
					<p>Towards the end of IAP, after being inspired by Alex Hattori, I decided to work on my very own BattleBot!</p>
					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/battleBot.png" alt="">
					<p>This is the original CAD that I made for my BattleBot. This changed because the waterjet was down and so I decided to mill the sides instead. I found a scrap piece of 3/8" thick, 2" by 15"
					piece of 6061 aluminum that I decided to use as the major part of the body.</p>
					<p>Also using a scrap large piece of 4" round aluminum stock I turned the pulley that is going to attach to the blade.</p>
					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/battlebots_pulley.jpg" alt="">
					<p>I will posting an update once I finish my BattleBot and after I have hopefully battled it out against other bots!</p>
